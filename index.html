            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>My name is Carizza Jhayne Bustamante, and I am 20 years old. I live in Bacnotan, La Union, Philippines.
            </p>


            <p>  Let me share a bit about my interests. Japanese cuisine holds a special place in my heart, and it's at
                the top of my travel bucket list. Once I graduate and have saved up enough, my dream is to visit Japan
                to experience its authentic flavors firsthand. After that, I’d love to explore Switzerland, as I’ve
                always been captivated by the beauty of its mountains and the charm of its snowy landscapes.
                Now, let me tell you a bit about my love life. I have a wonderful girlfriend who lives in Baguio, and
                she’s a third-year nursing student. Whenever I have some free time, I visit her in Baguio, and when
                she’s able to, she comes to La Union to spend time with me. One of our favorite things to do together is
                explore new places and travel, creating memories along the way.</p>

            <p>
                My goal after I graduate is to pursue a profession that I am truly passionate about, one that aligns
                with my skills and interests. I want to build a career that not only brings me personal fulfillment but
                also allows me to grow professionally. At the same time, I plan to save up enough money to eventually
                open my own business. This will give me the opportunity to invest in something I’m passionate about and
                secure my financial future. By doing so, I hope to ensure that my money is not just being spent, but is
                also working for me to generate additional income. My dream is to create a stable and successful life,
                where I can both enjoy my work and achieve financial independence.
            </p>

                <p>That's all for this activity! I hope you enjoyed reading about my experiences and getting to know
                    more about me. It’s been a pleasure sharing a glimpse into my life. I hope you don't judge me.</p>
